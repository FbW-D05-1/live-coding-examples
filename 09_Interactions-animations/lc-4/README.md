### Overview

Introduction to CSS `@keyframes` to control the steps and sequence of animations. The `transform` property will be used to rotate, scale, translate and skew an element.

### Main Concepts

- `@keyframes` gives us more control over the intermediate steps of the animation sequence than transitions
- Specifying start (`0% / from`) and end (`100%/ to`) states of an animation sequence
- Triggering animations with `:hover`
- Applying `animation-direction` and `animation-iteration-count`
