### Overview

Introduction of pseudo-elements to style a specific part of a selected element(s). In addition to styling specific parts of a text, we can use pseudo-elements to create shapes and to decorate our webpage. The `clip-path` property creates a clipping region that sets what part of an element should be shown. Parts that are inside the region are shown, while those outside are hidden.

### Main Concepts

- Explanation and examples of the following pseudo-elements - `::after`, `::before`, `::first-letter`, `::first-line`, `::placeholder` and `::selection`
- Creating shapes with `::before` and `::after`
- Using `clip-path` on elements to create intricate shapes
- A soft introduction to animation using the `:hover` pseudo-class
