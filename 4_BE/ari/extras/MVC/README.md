# MVC
Imagine you have a toy car. The toy car has different parts that work together to make it move. The wheels help it move forward, the steering wheel helps it turn, and the buttons on the remote control tell the car what to do.

In a similar way, a computer program has different parts that work together to make it work. MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, which are three important parts of a program.

The Model is like the engine of the toy car. It's responsible for the data and the logic of the program, just like the engine powers the car.

The View is like the windshield of the toy car. It's what you see on the screen and how the program looks, just like the windshield shows you what's in front of the car.

The Controller is like the remote control for the toy car. It tells the program what to do and how to respond to user input, just like the remote control tells the car which way to go.

So, just like the toy car needs all its parts to work together to move, a computer program needs the Model, View, and Controller to work together to function properly.
