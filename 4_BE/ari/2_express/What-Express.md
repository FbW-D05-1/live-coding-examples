# What is Express ?

Express is a Node framework(for example like jquery).

> Node recap: Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser. Runs on the V8 JavaScript Engine

Now Express does something really specific. For an example of this might be that you could own a screwdriver and you can screw all the screws you want using it, any type of screw. So that's Node. It lets you interact with the computer any way you like. But, as we know, if you've done a lot of work, screwing in screws manually using a screwdriver can get pretty tiring, and you're really at risk of repetitive strain injury, especially if you have a lot of Ikea furniture.

So that means in certain cases, for specialized uses, for example if you're doing a lot of DIY, then you might need a motorized screwdriver. And that's basically Express. It was built to make you write less repetitive code when you're building web applications, and it's made specifically for web developers.

So sometimes using Express vs using Node straight out of the box, you're saving yourself 5 to 10 times the amount of code that you have to write, and therefore a lot of time as well. And we programmers hate repetition, so Express is really really popular. If you check out the [npm Page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) it's still very popular, at the time of writing 29.468.472 Weekly Downloads!

Now let's go ahead and build a real server using Node and Express to see how we can get our server to start running code on the server side and start doing a lot of the heavy lifting, so we learn how to build a proper backend for our web sites.
