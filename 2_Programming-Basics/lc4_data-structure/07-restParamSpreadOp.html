    <h1>Summary</h1>

    <p>
        When we see "..." in the code, it is either rest syntax or the
        spread syntax. <small>Reminder: both are often referred to as
            "rest operator" or "spread operator"</small>
    </p>

    <p>There’s an easy way to distinguish between them:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>When ... is at the end of function parameters, it’s “rest parameters” and gathers the rest of the list of
            arguments into an array.</li>
        <li>When ... occurs in a function call or alike, it’s called a “spread syntax“ and expands an array into a list.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Use patterns:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Rest parameters are used to create functions that accept any number of arguments.</li>
        <li>The spread syntax is used to pass an array to functions that normally require a list of many arguments.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Together they help to travel between a list and an array of
        parameters with ease. All arguments of a function call are also
        available in “old-style” arguments: array-like iterable object
        (although that option is very rarely used).
