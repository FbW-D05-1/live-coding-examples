    <h1><u> JavaScript Functions: Best Practices </u></h1>
    <h2><u>Functions </u></h2>
    <h3> 1. Values passed to a function as parameters are copied to its local variables. </h3>
    <h3> 2. A function may access outer variables. But it works only from inside out. The code outside of the function
        doesn’t see its local variables. </h3>
    <h3> 3. A function can return a value. If it doesn’t, then its result is undefined. </h3>
    <h3> 4. To make the code clean and easy to understand, it’s recommended to use mainly local variables and parameters
        in the function, not outer variables. </h3>
    <h3> 5. It is always easier to understand a function which gets parameters, works with them and returns a result
        than a function which gets no parameters, but modifies outer variables as a side-effect. </h3>

    <h2><u>Naming a Function </u></h2>
    <h3> 1. The name should be brief. </h3>
    <h3> 2. The name should be as accurate as possible.</h3>
    <h3> 3. The name should describe what the function does.</h3>
    <h3> 4. A function is an action, so function names are usually verbal.</h3>
    <h3> 5. Start a function with a verbal prefix which vaguely describes the action. </h3>
    <h3> Function can starting with…</h3>

    <h3>"get…" – return a value,</h3>
    <h3>"calc…" – calculate something,</h3>
    <h3>"create…" – create something,</h3>
    <h3>"check…" – check something and return a boolean, etc.</h3>

    <h2><u> One function – one action </u></h2>

    <h3>1. A function should do exactly what is suggested by its name, no more.</h3>
    <h3>Functions should be short and do exactly one thing.</h3>
    <h3>2. Two independent actions usually deserve two functions, even if they are usually called together (in that case
        we can make a 3rd function that calls those two).</h3>
    <h3>3. A separate function is not only easier to test and debug – its very existence is a great comment!</h3>
