    <h1><u>Function Declaration vs Function Expression</u></h1>

    <h2><u>Function Expression</u></h2>
    <h3> - A Function Expression is created when the execution reaches it and is usable from then on.</h3>

    <h3> - Once the execution flow passes to the right side of the assignment let sum = function… , the function is
        created and can be used (assigned, called, etc. ) from now on.</h3>

    <h3> - Function Expressions are created when the execution reaches them. </h3>

    <h2><u>Function Declaration</u></h2>
    <h3> - A Function Declaration is usable in the whole script/code block. </h3>
    <h3> - When JavaScript prepares to run the script or a code block, it first looks for Function Declarations in it
        and creates the functions. We can think of it as an “initialization stage”.</h3>
    <h3> - After all of the Function Declarations are processed, the execution goes on.</h3>

    <h3> - A function declared as a Function Declaration can be called earlier than it is defined. </h3>

    <h3> - When a Function Declaration is made within a code block, it is visible everywhere inside that block. But not
        outside of it. </h3>

    <h2><u>When should you choose Function Declaration versus Function Expression?</u></h2>

    <h3> First consider Function Declaration syntax. It gives more freedom in how to organize our code, because we can
        call such functions before they are declared. </h3>

    <h3> Function Declarations are more “eye-catching”. </h3>
