// General introduction
// PROGRAM SUBMODULE
// What is the normal flow of a program?

// From top to bottom! Normally!
// From left to right "LTR"
let number = 5;
console.log(++number);

// Logical Thinking
// What is a program also called?
// Algorithm
// Specific flow of instructions
// How input is transferred into output
// INPUT => ALGORITHM => OUTPUT

// Analyze Problems: What is the input? What is the output?
// Think about before starting to program
// What if I want to make a lasagna?
// What are the steps?

// 0. Grocery Shopping
// 1. INPUT: Ingredients? Pasta, Vegetables, Bechamel Sauce, Ragout
// 2. Start the oven, preheat
// 3. Cook ragout
// 4. Cook Bechamel
// 5. Make layers with Pasta, Bechamel and ragout
// 6. Put the pasta in the oven
// 7. Wait 30 minutes
// 8. OUTPUT: LASAGNA
// 9. Eat it!

// Order is important, we need to tell the computer each single step
// he doesn't know anything !!! we can google :D but the computer cannot..
// if you don't how exactly to do a lasagna, search for a recipe! => get the algorithm!

// Lets make DUMPLINGS :D
// INPUT: Flour, Yeast, Vegetables, Spring Onion, Carrots, Mince, Spices (Salt, Pepper, Sugar, Soya Sauce...)
// 1. Make the dough (500g + 340g of Water + 3g Yeast + 5g Salt + 15g Sugar )
// 2. Let it sit half an hour...
// 3. Meanwhile Chop vegetables
// 4. Mix Spices with vegetables everything together
// 5. Grab small ball of dough, make it flat, put ingredients in, wrap it up!
// 6. Let is sit again for half an hour...
// 7. Cook: Put all dumplings in a flat pan with water 0.5cm, close the lid => Steam cooking
// 8. Make it hot!!! 7-6
// 9. Cook it for 15-20 minutes
// 10. Until water is gone => Fork Test => Ready?
// OUTPUT: Dumplings

// Come up with solutions: We will face a lot of problems
// How can we achieve something? => writing algorithms
// A RECIPE IS LIKE A ALGORITHM
// BE AS PRECISE AS POSSIBLE !

// BEST PRACTICES
// Don't repeat yourself => DRY Principle

// Input  => Algorithm => Output
// 2, 5	  => Blackbox  =>  5
// 0, 100 => Blackbox  => 100
// 52, 35 => Blackbox  => 52

// Let a be the first input.
// Let b be the second input.
// If a is greater than b, print a.
// If b is greater than a, print b.

// General rule ?
// Finding the biggest
// How can we find out the biggest number?

// Solution Pseudo Code for Blackbox Number 1:
//  If the first number is bigger than the second number,
//      give me first number.
//  Otherwise
//      give me the second number.
