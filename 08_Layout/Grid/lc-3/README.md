## Overview

In this exercise we crate a full-page layout by taking advantage of `grid-template-areas`. A flexbox component is introduced to demonstrate a simple use case for the combination of the two methods.

## Main Concepts

- `grid-template-areas` specifies named grid areas, establishing the cells in the grid and assigning them names
- Flexbox is ideal for one-dimensional layouts, Grid for two-dimensional layouts.
- Grid is for large scale layouts, flexbox for components
