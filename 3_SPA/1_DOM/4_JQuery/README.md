# What is JQuery?

### JQuery is a JS Library which was very popular and shortens selecors

### John Resig was very frustated with JS having long selectors hence why he wrote a library called JQuery


# What does JQuery allow you to do?

### for example take this line of code:

```js
document.querySelector("h1");
```

### With Jquery we get rid most of the code. That will look like this:
```js
jQuery("h1");
```

#### or even shorter with "$" symbol
```js
$("h1");
```

### basically document.querySelector("h1"); and $("h1"); are the same but JQuery can select all elements without using a loop which we will learn later on
