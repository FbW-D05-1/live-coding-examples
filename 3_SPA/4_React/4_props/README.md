## Props

Props are basically how we can transfer/ pass down data from parent component to one of it's child components and from that child to the next one

So if we had multiple pages in our website, we could reuse the prop-data on each page but pass a different prop-data into it each time

Note: any data type or even a function can be passed down as a prop
