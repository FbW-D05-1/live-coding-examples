        // what a promise does it gives us a value that will be fulfilled at some time
        // it promises us that it will gives us the data once it will be returned
        console.log(todo)

        // how do we do that

        // then takes in a callback function, it will fire WHEN its complete
        // we can take that response and work with it
        // the response will be gibberish to us until we turn it into json
        fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
            .then(response => console.log(response))


        // hello will be clg'd before our fetch cause promise only logs when it's fulfilled
        console.log("hello");


        //turning response to json so it's readable and usable
