# JSON Format
JavaScript Object Notation

Notice how data that you get back in JSON looks remarkably how we create JS Objects


When we create actual JS Objects we have variable name/ keys without quotation marks etc:
```js
const warderobe = {
    doors: 2,
    drawers: 2,
    colour: "red"
}
```

Think about it as a Ikea Warderobe you can use it to store everything you need and if you need to move you can easily take it apart and transport it elsewhere
```js
{doors:2,drawers:2,colour:'red'}
```

JSON is not the only format we can recieve from an API, see [openweather](https://openweathermap.org/current) on the side bar you have Format click it and you get JSON, XML, HTML

XML => Extensible Markup Language

HTML => You know what it is :-)

JSON is the most Favorite Format, it's lightweight and easy to turn back into JS Objects.

To see every JSON in readable format use JSON Viewer Awesome for Chrome, Firefox has it prebuilt
